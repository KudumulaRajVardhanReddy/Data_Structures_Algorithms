A personal collection of Data Structures & Algorithms, periodically revised to maintain a strong foundation in computer science. While my main focus lies in Quant Finance, Full-Stack development, and AOSP, I consistently revisit DSA to strengthen problem-solving skills, sharpen fundamentals, and stay prepared for competitive programming challenges. Organized, practiced, and evolving alongside my broader tech journey.
